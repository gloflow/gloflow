Media publishing/management/manipulation system.

(note: this is alpha software, not feature complete, and still missing more code that needs to be migrated to this repo)

Its purpose is to help manage media (for now mainly images) libraries, to edit media, publish it, exchange it with other people, to analyse it. 
Its goal is to provide free and private exchange of media between people and groups of people. It currently runs as a centralized service, but my aim is for it to also be fully decentralized and run in a P2P network. 

Images/videos are at the core of our culture, at the core of how we perceive the world and how we remember ideas and moments. We communicate most effectivelly when we exchange images. There should be a technology that is focused on that, that is modern, accessible to technical people for modification/integration and automation, and most importantly free and independent of any single individuals or groups possible control.

This project is still very much work in progress. I doubt that it will ever be done, or truly "ready". I worked on it over the years in an largely unplanned manner, working on parts that were interesting to me, when I had free time and wanted to just hack without deadlines or immediate purpose. There were various pauses in development due to work and general life, but I always came back to it. 
It has been rewritten 3 times since I wrote the first official code in 2012 (that went online). 

Originally it was coded in Python on the backend, and JS on the frontend. Later the entire thing was rewritten in Dart on both the frontend and backend. Finally the backend was rewritten in Go-lang, and frontend in TypeScript.
