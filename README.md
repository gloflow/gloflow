Media publishing/management system

its purpose is to help manage image libraries, to edit images, publish them, exchange them with other people you know, to analyse them. 
its goal is to provide free and private exchange of images between people and groups of people. It can run as a centralized service, but my goal is for it to also be fully decentralized. 
Images are at the core of our culture, at the core of how we perceive the world and how we remember ideas and moments. There should be a technology that is focused on that, that is modern, accessible to technical people for modification/integration, and most importantly free and independent of any single individual or group.

This project is still work in progress. I doubt that it will ever be done, or "ready". I worked on it over the years in an largely unplanned manner, working on parts that were interesting to me, when I had free time and wanted to just hack without deadlines or immediate purpose. There were various pauses in development due to work and general life, but I always came back to it. 
It has been rewritten 3 times since I wrote the first official code in 2012 that went online. 

Originally it was coded in Python on the backend, and JS on the frontend. Later the entire thing was rewritten in Dart on both the frontend and backend. Finally the backend was rewritten in Go-lang, and frontend in TypeScript.
