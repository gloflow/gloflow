(note: this is Beta software, and not feature complete)

GloFlow is a set of tools meant for media **discovery**/**curation**.  
Its purpose is to help manage media (for now mainly images) collections, to **edit** media, **publish** it, **share** it with other people, **analyse** it.  
Its goal is to provide free and private exchange of media between people and groups of people. It currently runs as a centralized service, but the aim is for it to also be fully decentralized and run in a P2P network. 

Images/videos are at the core of our social **culture**, at the core of how we perceive the world and how we **remember ideas** and **moments**. **We communicate most effectivelly when we exchange visual information**. There should be a technology that is focused on that, that is modern, accessible to technical people for modification/integration and automation, and most importantly **free** and **independent** of any single individuals or groups (and their possible control).

This project is still very much work in progress. It has been worked on over the years in an largely unplanned manner, adding parts that were of interest at the time. 
It has been rewritten 3 times since I wrote the first official code in **2012** (when it went online).
